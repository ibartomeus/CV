# CV

This pretends to automatically generate my CV in different formats from G scholar and a csv where I can easily update all my achivements.  
It simply uses Rmarkdown to read a csv file and Gscholar real time info and formats everything as desired. See https://github.com/ibartomeus/CV/blob/master/Bartomeus_CV_exahustive.md for the content formated.
